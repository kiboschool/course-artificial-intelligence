# Word Representation
To make our job easier while working with text on a computer, we need to represent words in a way that will help us solve a certain task, such as text classification or named entity recognition. In this lesson, we will discuss different ways to represent words and documents like one-hot encoding, word embeddings, and bag-of-words.


### One-hot encoding
One simple way to represent words is to use one-hot encoding, where each word is represented by a vector of zeros, except for one element that is one. This technique is commonly used in machine learning models to represent categories numerically instead of using words. In NLP, here is how it looks:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../images/one-hot-encoding.png" alt="One-hot encoding"  width = "400"/>
</p>

This is a very simple approach; however, simplicity comes at a cost. To represent each word in a text, we need a vector of size equal to the size of the vocabulary, which can be very large. Also, this approach does not capture the meaning of words and it does not take into account the context in which the words are used. Two words that have similar meanings will have totally different one-hot encodings.


## Distributed Representation and Word Embeddings
To address the meaning problem, we can store words using real numbers, where each word is represented by a vector of real numbers and each element of the vector represents a feature of the word. Words with similar meanings will have vector values close to each other. This approach is called **distributed representation**. To generate these vectors, we can utilize machine learning models trained on large amounts of text data. Based on the context, the computer can learn words with similar or related meanings.

### Word2vec
Word2Vec is a popular model for word distributional representation, developed by researchers at Google. It operates on the principle that words which appear in similar contexts often share similar meanings. Word2vec employs a shallow neural network to learn word representations from extensive text corpora.

I'm blown away by the king-queen example in the above video. It's amazing how `word2vec` can capture the meaning of words.

### Word Embeddings
Word embedding, a form of distributed representation, captures semantic relationships between words by mapping them to dense, low-dimensional vectors within a continuous vector space. Word2Vec serves as a specific algorithm for word embedding.


âœ… Try this [interesting tool](https://projector.tensorflow.org/) to experiment with word embeddings. Clicking on one word reveals clusters of similar words: 'toy' clusters with 'Disney', 'LEGO', 'PlayStation', and 'console'.

Here's a Python example for word embedding:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

# Example sentences
sentences = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "The cat is cute.",
    "The dog is friendly."
]


# Tokenize the sentences
tokenized_sentences = [word_tokenize(sentence.lower()) for sentence in sentences]

# Train the Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(sentences=tokenized_sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)

# Get the word vectors
word_vectors = model.wv

# Print the word vector for a specific word
print("Vector representation of 'dog':", word_vectors['dog'])

# Find similar words
similar_words = word_vectors.most_similar('dog')
print("Words similar to 'dog':", similar_words)
```

### Bag-of-Words
Bag-of-Words (BoW) is a simple and popular method for representing text data. It is based on the idea that the order of words in a document does not matter, and that the presence of words in a document is more important than the order of the words. In our previous section when we talked about cleaning text by removing stop words and punctuation, we were preparing the text for BoW.

BoW represents a document as a vector of word counts. Each element in the vector represents the count of a word in the document. The size of the vector is equal to the size of the vocabulary. Here's an example of how to use BoW in `nltk`:


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
corpus = [
    'This is the first document.',
    'This document is the second document.',
    'And this is the third one.',
    'Is this the first document?',
]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X.toarray())
```

The output of this code will be:

```
['and' 'document' 'first' 'is' 'one' 'second' 'the' 'third' 'this']
[[0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1]
 [0 2 0 1 0 1 1 0 1]
 [1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1]
]
```

In the above sample, we can see that the word "document" appears once in the first document (first text in the corpus list), twice in the second document, 0 times in the third, and once in the fourth.


### Document-Term Matrix (DTM):
DTM represents documents as rows and words (terms) as columns in a matrix. Each cell in the matrix represents the frequency of a particular word in a particular document.

This format is called the document-term matrix. Each row in the matrix represents a document, and each column represents a word in the vocabulary. The value in each cell represents the count of the word in the document. The document-term matrix can be used as input to machine learning models for tasks such as text classification, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.

For example, if we have three documents ["The cat is cute.", "The dog is cute too.", "The cat and the dog are friends."], and a vocabulary of ["the", "cat", "is", "cute", "dog", "too", "and", "are", "friends"], the DTM might look like:



|      | the | cat | is | cute | dog | too | and | are | friends |
|------|-----|-----|----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Doc1 | 1   | 1   | 1  | 1    | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0       |
| Doc2 | 1   | 0   | 1  | 1    | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0       |
| Doc3 | 2   | 1   | 1  | 0    | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1       |


### Comparison
Each of the above techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of representation depends on the specific task at hand. Let's summarize the differences between word embedding, DTM, and BoW:
