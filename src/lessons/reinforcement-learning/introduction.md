# Introduction
Welcome to an exciting new week of artificial intelligence! This week, you will learn about reinforcement learning, a subfield of machine learning. Reinforcement learning is used in many applications such as robotics, video games, and self-driving cars.

Reinforcement learning is a framework for agents to learn how to interact with an environment from experience, somewhat like how a baby learns from interacting with the world. 

### Watch this video that shows simulation results of different reinforcement learning agents learning to walk.

Reinforcement learning proves to be extremely useful and efficient in situations where labeled data or clear objectives are absent. For example, in self-driving cars, the car just learns to drive by interacting with the environment.

By the end of this week, you will build similar agents that learn by interacting with their environment.
