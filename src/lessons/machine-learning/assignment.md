Your task for this assignment is to implement a Naive Bayes classifier to identify potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing a loan.

## Instructions

** A complete guide has been provided in the Colab notebook below to help you complete the assignment.**

- Use this [bank_loan dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vG-uzI_qBfMgnJ_mgSWtfkL62Ii8Zvwy/view?usp=sharing) to train and test your model.
- Create a Colab notebook and write your code in it.
- Without using any high-level libraries like `sklearn` or `tensorflow`, implement the Naive Bayes classifier to predict the potential customers who have a higher probability of accepting the personal loan offer.
- The dataset contains 12 featurs and 1 target variable ("Personal Loan"). 
    - age : Customer's age in completed years
    - experience : years of professional experience
    - income : Annual income of the customer
    - zip_code : Home Address ZIP code.
    - family : Family size of the customer
    - ccavg : Avg. spending on credit cards per month
    - education : Education Level (Undergrad, Graduate, Advanced/Professional)
    - mortgage : Value of house mortgage if any.
    - personal_loan : Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last campaign?
    - securities_account : Does the customer have a securities account with the bank?
    - cd_account : Does the customer have a certificate of deposit (CD) account with the bank?
    - online : Does the customer use internet banking facilities?
- Implement basic data exploration techniques to understand the dataset.
