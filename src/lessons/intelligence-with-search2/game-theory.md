# Game Theory
Mathematical game theory, a branch of economics, views any multiagent environment as a game, provided that the impact of each agent on the others is "significant," regardless  of whether the agents are cooperative or competitive. In AI, the most common games are of a rather specialized kind——what game theorists call deterministic, turn-taking, two-player, ZERO-SUM GAMES zero-sum games of perfect information (such as chess). (Russle and Norvig)

In our terminology, this means deterministic, fully observable environments in which two agents act alternately and in which the utility values at the end of the game are always equal and opposite. For example, if one player wins a game of chess, the other player necessarily loses. It is this opposition between the agents’ utility functions that makes the situation adversarial. (Russle and Norvig)
