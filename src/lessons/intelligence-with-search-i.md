# Intelligence with Search I

Welcome to the first week of the course. During this week, we will begin with an introduction to the field of AI and discuss some of the key concepts that you need to grasp before you start building AI systems. Subsequently, we will introduce the concept of search problems and explore how to solve them using various search algorithms. We will also delve into the application of these search algorithms in designing artificial agents capable of planning.

The assignment for this week entails building a shipping route finder using the A\* search algorithm.

Upon completing this week, you will be able to:

- Describe the field of AI and its fundamental concepts.
- Define search problems and learn how to solve them with - various search algorithms.
- Apply search algorithms to the design of artificial agents capable of planning.
- Build a shipping route finder utilizing the A\* search algorithm.
