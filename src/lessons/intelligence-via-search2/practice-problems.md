# Practice Problems
You may choose one of the following problems to practice your skills, or you can tackle both if you prefer. The first problem is a video tutorial on how to implement a Connect 4 AI using the minimax algorithm. The second problem is ...

## Problem 1 : Connect 4 AI
Here is a complete video tutorial on how to implement a Connect 4 AI using the minimax algorithm. The tutorial is in Python. 

Although this is a lengthy video, it is worthwhile. You will gain a lot of insights!

### How to get the most out of this tutorial:
1. Download the [starter code](https://github.com/KeithGalli/Connect4-Python/blob/master/connect4.py) and get familiar with it.
2. Try to implement the minimax algorithm on your own. Push yourself harder than you think necessary. It's okay if you don't succeed at first. Just give it your best effort.

3. Watch the video without coding along. Try to understand the code and the algorithm while looking at the starter code you downloaded.
4. Try one more time to implement the minimax algorithm on your own. You should be able to do a good part of it now, if not all of it.
5. Watch the video again and code along. Pause the video from time to time to try to implement the code on your own.
