# Search Problem Formulation [draft]

Before we start solving a problem, below are useful questions to ask:

{TBD}

informatino about the world is known
assumption aboutt he environment

- episodic
- single agent
- fully observable
- deterministic
- static
- discrete
- known

The agent knows details about the whole world it operates in. It knows the initial state, the actions it can take, and the goal state. It also knows the transition model, which is the result of taking an action in a state. The agent also knows the goal test, which is a function that determines whether a given state is a goal state. Finally, the agent knows the path cost function, which assigns a numeric cost to each path.

if agent does not know -> next week lesson

branching strategy

Actions as functions

Result function - transitino model
