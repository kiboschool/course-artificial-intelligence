## A\* Search Algorithm

The A\* search algorithm is an informed search algorithm. Beside using a heuristic function, like the greedy best-first search algorithm, it also uses the cost of the path from the start state to the current state to guide its search. The cost of the path is also known as the **g-value**. As a function. it is denoted as `g(n)`. The heuristic function is denoted as `h(n)`. The A\* search algorithm uses the following function to guide its search:

`f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`


### Different Heuristic Functions

Based on the nature of the problem, we can design different heuristic functions. For instance, in our car example, we can use the direct line distance between the goal state and each state as a heuristic function. In the 15-Puzzle problem, we can use the number of misplaced tiles as a heuristic function. Let's modify the 15-Puzzle problem to use the A\* search algorithm and see how it performs.
