Ever wondered how chatbots, such as ChatGPT, can feel so remarkably human-like in their responses? Or marveled at how your favorite virtual assistant always seems to know just what you need? Get ready to uncover the exciting secrets behind language translation, text summarization, question answering, text classification, and much more! Welcome to the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP)! It's the groundbreaking technology that makes all of this possible.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics. It focuses on the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages.

When we discussed computer vision, we learned that its aim is to empower computers to comprehend, analyze, and effectively utilize visual information. Similarly, NLP serves the same purpose but for textual data. It involves the capability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken or written.


After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain what Natural Language Processing (NLP) is.
- Clean text data.
- Perform basic NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Explain Language Models and their applications.
- Build NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, and text generation.
