# Assignment: Face Recognition

In this assignment, you will build a face recognition model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). You will use the [ORL Faces](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tdNSb0p_1gvPQC56KN4u7TQpA4pH-MfO/view?usp=sharing) dataset to train and test your model.

Please follow the instructions in the Colab notebook to complete the assignment. Some parts of the code are already implemented for you. You should write the code only where you are instructed to do so.
