ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the first week of the course. In this week, you will be introduced to the field of AI and the fundamental concepts necessary for building AI systems.

You'll learn how to achieve intelligence by modeling and solving search problems. We will learn how to solve problems like maze navigation and pathfinding using different search algorithms like depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A\* search.

## This Week's Assessments:

Your tasks for this week are:

- Quiz (7.5% of your grade).
- Coding Assignment (10% of your grade).

The coding assignment will involve "Building a shipping route planner using the A\* search algorithm."

**Upon completing this week, you will be able to:**

- Describe the field of AI and its fundamental concepts.
- Define search problems and learn how to solve them with various search algorithms.
- Apply search algorithms to the design of artificial agents capable of planning.
