ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the first week of the course. In this week, you will be introduced to the field of AI and the fundamental concepts necessary for building AI systems.

You will acquire practical skills in modeling and constructing programs to achieve intelligence by addressing search problems. We will learn how to solve problems like maze navigation and pathfinding using different search algorithms like depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A\* search.

## This Week's Work:

- Study the material and solve the practical exercises.
- Complete the quiz and coding assignment of this week. The coding assignment will involve "Building a shipping route planner using the A\* search algorithm."

**Upon completing this week, you will be able to:**

- Develop intelligent software agents capable of solving diverse problems, such as pathfinding, and playing games like the 15-puzzle.
- Explain the field of AI and its fundamental concepts.
