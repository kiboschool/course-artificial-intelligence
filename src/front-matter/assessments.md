> description should be provided for each assessment tool that the course uses with additional details (i.e. purpose of
> the assessment tool, how they are submitted, etc.)

In this course, you will be assessed on your ability to apply the concepts and techniques covered in class to solve
problems. You will be assessed through a combination of programming assignments, quizzes, and a final project.


You overall course grade is composed of these weighted elements:

- Programming Assignments/Projects: 30%
- Quizzes: 40%
- Final Project/Exam: 30%
- Oral Exam

## Quizzes

Most weeks, there will be a short quiz in Gradescope on the material covered in the lessons (8 quizzes total).

These quizzes will make up 20% of your overall course grade.

- Quizzes will be released in Gradescope each week.
- Quizzes will be due at the end of each week.
- Submit each quiz in Gradescope, then submit a pdf of your quiz in Anchor

## Programming Assignments

During some weeks, you'll be given an assignment to test the new skills and
concepts you learned. The assignments will be challenging, and it's recommended
that you complete the material and practice problems before you start the
project each week.

There will be six assignments overall.

## Final Project/Exam

There will be a final project/exam held during the middle of the term. More details to come.

## Oral Exam

Based on your coursework and assignment submissions, you may be required to participate in an oral exam. This is
designed to ensure that you have a solid understanding of the course material and have independently completed your
work.

## Late Policy

- Late assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the original due date, but a **late penalty of 10%** will be
  applied for _each day_ the assignment is late.

- If a student has a legitimate reason for being unable to submit an assignment on time (e.g. illness, family
  emergency), they may request an extension by sending an email to the instructor. Such requests must be made at least
  24 hours before the original due date. The instructor will review each request and decide whether to grant an
  extension on a case-by-case basis.

- If an extension is granted, the new due date will be determined by the instructor and communicated to the student.
  Late penalties will still apply if the assignment is not submitted by the new due date.
