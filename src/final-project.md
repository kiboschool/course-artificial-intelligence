# Final Project
The final project is an opportunity for you to apply the knowledge and skills that you have learned in the course to a real-world problem. You are required to select one of the provided project ideas, develop a working solution, and submit 3 key deliverables:
- **Working Project**: A functional AI-based system. 
- **Source Code**: The source code of the project (Github link).
- **Project Report**: A document detailing your development process, including the sections below.


**Team Size:** 1 - 3 

**Submission Deadline:** 14 June 2024
**Submission Link:** [Submit Your Project](/assignments/final_project.pdf)


## Progressive Project Report
>You are required to fill the project report progressively while working during week 9 and week 10. Otherwise, your submission might not be accepted. Progressively means that you should fill the report as you work on the project, not all at once at the end of the project.



## Project Report
Your project report (a sample can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X3rjn1HsVsckRuy0N0Fp8QtcJYEmTxx8oUA4P5__x3s/edit?usp=sharing).) must document the following steps:

- **Problem Identification**: Clearly define your project's computational problem (~50 words).
- **Exploration of Alternatives**: Investigate various algorithms and methodologies that could solve the problem. Discuss the pros and - cons of at least three approaches (~200 words).
- **Selection and Justification**: Choose the most appropriate solution and provide a rationale for your choice based on its - efficiency, accuracy, and suitability for the problem (~50 words).
- **Implementation Details**: Provide details on the dataset used, the model/algorithm chosen, the frameworks and tools, etc.
- **Demo Link**: Include a link to a working demo of the project. It could be a live link on the web or a recorded video.

## Project Ideas

### Project 1: AI-Powered Home Security System

**Objective**: Develop a system that utilizes cameras placed at home entrances to detect and alert homeowners about human presence in a designated security zone.
**Requirements**: Implement an object detection system to identify human figures in a video feed.

### Project 2: Stock Market Prediction

**Objective**: Construct a model to forecast future stock prices using historical data.

**Requirements**: Develop a time series forecasting model that predicts the stock price of a certain company. Visualize prediction accuracy and model performance.

### Project 3: Business Question Answering System

**Objective**: Build an AI-driven system that acts as a customer service agent to answer frequently asked questions about a business.

**Requirements**: Develop a natural language processing model capable of understanding and responding to user queries.


# Evaluation Rubric
